# Sign-Language-Project
This project aims to create a system that recognizes specific signs from American Sign Language (ASL) in real-time using a webcam. The primary objective is to identify and interpret a set of selected signsâ€”Hello, Thank you, Yes, No, and Please. By leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques.
